# Media Element Schema
A JSON Schema toolkit for bibliographic citations.

## Background
This project was developed out of the desire to have a lightweight and easy-to-use bibliographic citation generator.

This is a work-in-progress schema, not yet ready for stable usage.

## Guide to this Repository
- `src/` contains the source JSON Schema and a sample of valid instances under `schema/` and a `scripts/` directory for a simple citation generator and schema validator.
- `documentation/` contains a user-guide and other related documentation.
